# Nuke Mode — a second list, a physical key, and no daily pass

Covers what Nuke is, how it is stored, where it joins enforcement, what it overrides, the gates that
keep it from being theatre, and — honestly — what it cannot stop.
**Read before touching `domain/nuke/`, `ui/nuke/`, `ui/screens/nuke/`, `NukeSafetyFloor`, the Nuke
lines in `NudgeAccessibilityService`, `NukeBlockContent`, or any gate on the master toggle.**

## What it is (Anti, 2026-09-29)

> "A nuke option you can click, like a focus mode. When activated it's a DIFFERENT list — separate
> from the usual apps you block in Nudge. When nuke is on, every app in the nuke list you just cannot
> open. Pair it with toggling nuke via a QR code — scan the QR code to turn it on AND off. And an
> emergency option: you can disable the nuke, but you have to type a long thing. Just make it
> annoying."

So Nuke is three things:

1. **A list** of packages, independent of `BlockRule`s and groups. A rule-less app can be nuked; a
   nuked app's own rules are simply overridden while Nuke is on and come back untouched when it ends.
2. **A key**: a QR Nudge generates (`nudge-nuke:` + 32 `SecureRandom` bytes, base64url), or any
   QR/barcode the user already has. Scanning it while Nuke is off turns it ON; scanning it while on
   turns it OFF. A plain "Nuke now" button also turns it on, because strengthening is always free.
3. **An emergency way out**: a fresh random 64-character code, typed by hand, case-sensitive, paste
   suppressed. Annoying on purpose.

## The model

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NukeState(active, packages, keyHash, keyKind)` | `domain/nuke/NukeState.kt` | The whole persisted state as one value. `packages` is RAW: it may hold a floor package, so nothing enforces off it directly. v1 is one list; a multi-profile version would make this "the default profile" additively. |
| Key generation, hashing, matching | `domain/nuke/NukeKey.kt` | Only the lowercase-hex SHA-256 of the trimmed payload is stored. Constant-time compare (`MessageDigest.isEqual`). Blank and >4096-char payloads are never keys. |
| Every decision | `domain/nuke/NukePolicy.kt` | `isNuked`, the safety floor, `armBlocker`/`canArm`, `isWeakening(old, new)`, `masterToggleOffRequiresUnlock`. |
| Scan meaning | `domain/nuke/NukeScan.kt` | `resolveToggle` → Arm / Disarm / WrongKey / NoKey / CannotArm / Cancelled. `NukeEmergencyCode` (length 64, `SecureRandom`) reuses `StrictModeChallenge` wholesale. |
| Persistence | `NudgePreferences` (`NUKE_*` keys) | DataStore, so it survives reboot and service restarts. Dumb writes, except ONE invariant: never on without a key (`setNukeActive(true)` with no key stays off; `clearNukeKey()` also turns Nuke off). |
| Device safety floor | `service/NukeSafetyFloor.kt` | This phone's launcher(s), default dialer (`TelecomManager`), keyboards (`InputMethodManager`), own package, plus `SYSTEM_PACKAGES` / `IME_PACKAGES` / Settings packages. Binder calls, cached 5 minutes, off-main only. |
| Evaluation hook | `NukeEnforcement` (interface) → `NukeEnforcementSource` | What `EvaluateBlockUseCase` asks. |

**Why SHA-256 and not bcrypt.** A password hash slows down guessing a low-entropy secret. A
generated key is 256 random bits. A product barcode is low-entropy, but the attacker in this threat
model is the user holding the phone, who can walk to the cupboard or type the emergency code far
faster than they can brute-force a digest. The hash protects the payload from being READ (a backup,
a debug dump, a prefs file), not from being guessed.

## Where it joins enforcement

### The pure step
`BlockEngine.evaluate(..., nuked = true)` returns `BlockEngine.NUKE_DECISION` as its FIRST step: a
`HARD_BLOCK` flagged `nuke = true`, with no delay, no daily-limit fields, no grayscale and no tab
cover. It overrides every rule and every limit rather than competing with them (`BlockEngineNukeTest`
runs every `BlockMode` × limit spent/unspent × feature/no feature and asserts the WHOLE decision).

`EvaluateBlockUseCase.invoke` asks `NukeEnforcement.isNuked(pkg)` before any rule or usage read. Its
constructor takes the enforcement with NO default: a defaulted "never nuked" is the silent no-op that
would let every nuked app open. Every app-level caller goes through `invoke` — the foreground event,
the issue #7 content-change fallback, in-app feature detection, the Reels tab cover, the daily-limit
clock (`enforceExhaustedBudget`) — so there is one place Nuke joins evaluation.

It is a `HARD_BLOCK` on purpose, not a new `BlockMode`: the stats, the walk-away row, `KNOWN_MODES`,
the interventions chart and `enforceExhaustedBudget` all already understand a hard block, and a
sixth mode would have meant the four hand-edited mode lists in `block-overlay-lifecycle.md` all over
again. The `nuke` flag is what the overlay and the launch fingerprint read.

### The service (the hot path)
`NudgeAccessibilityService` caches `nukeActiveCached` + `nukedPackagesCached` (the ENFORCEABLE set,
device floor already removed) off-main from `NudgePreferences.nukeState`, exactly like Strict Mode
and the master toggle. `isNukedNow` re-applies the static floor on top, so a stale cache still cannot
nuke the dialer. The event path never blocks on DataStore or PackageManager.

Every site it touches:

| Site | What changed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `evaluateForegroundPackage` | The daily pass, the auto-kick cooldown overlay, the time-remaining overlay and the passthrough skip were extracted into `grantLetsThrough`, and a nuked package never consults it: `if (!nuked && grantLetsThrough(...)) return`. | These are all ways INTO an app a rule gates. None is a way into a nuked app. Everything above (grayscale, web session end, counter, clock) still runs. |
| same, browser branch | `if (!nuked && isBrowser(pkg))` | A nuked browser is blocked as an APP, whatever site is open. |
| `handleWindowContentChanged` | A nuked package outside `InAppDetector.SUPPORTED_PACKAGES` takes the verified #7 switch check instead of the URL-bar read. | Otherwise a nuked browser re-entered via content changes only could reach `evaluateWebDomain`, which can only block a SITE. Supported packages already re-evaluate the whole app on every content change. |
| `detectAndEvaluateFeature` | Stands down for a nuked app. | The foreground path already blocked it whole; a feature evaluation on top would launch the same block again under a different confrontation key. |
| `onServiceConnected` collector | On apps becoming nuked (Nuke ON, or apps added while on), `reevaluateForegroundForNuke` reads the live active window and, if it is a newly nuked app, spends the debounce and evaluates it. | A grant open when Nuke starts (a completed delay, a daily pass, a cooldown) must not keep the app on screen until the next window event. Usually the user armed Nuke from inside Nudge, so this is a no-op. |
| `handleDecision` | `EXTRA_NUKE`; fingerprint mode `"NUKE"` | A pending RULE hard block for the same app must not swallow the Nuke block as a duplicate (issue #50's shape). The ROW is still `blockMode = HARD_BLOCK`. |
| `maybeGuardSettingsEscape` | Engages while Nuke is on, at `max(64, strict length)`. | See the escape route below. |

**Untouched on purpose:** the Home/SystemSurface early return (launcher, SystemUI, Settings are on the
floor and can never be nuked, so nothing below it concerns Nuke), the PiP / own-UI / transient
returns (they are not the user being in an app), and the global master-toggle gate (Nuke lives UNDER
it — see the master toggle gate below).

### The overlay
`BlockOverlayActivity` renders `NukeBlockContent` for a `HARD_BLOCK` carrying `EXTRA_NUKE`: "Nuked.
[App] is off until you end Nuke. Scan your Nuke code to end it." and ONE button, "Go home", wired to
the same `navigateHome()` every block uses — the walk-away row, `GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME`, the #26
departure window. `NukeBlockContent` takes no emergency-pass parameters at all, so the daily pass
cannot be put on it by any caller (`NukeWiringContractTest`). There is no completion path, like any
hard block.

## Why there is no daily 2-minute pass

The daily pass exists so that a RULE, which the user set in a calm moment, has a cheap, rationed
exit for the moment the rule is wrong. Nuke is the opposite commitment: the user has chosen,
deliberately, a mode with no cheap exit, and has moved the exit somewhere physical. A 2-minute pass
on a nuked app would make Nuke a rule with extra steps. The exits are the key and the 64-character
code; both live in the app, never on the block.

## The gates (else Nuke is theatre)

`NukePolicy.isWeakening(old, new)` is the policy; `ui/nuke/NukeGate` is the ViewModel-side gate
(same shape as `StrictModeGate`: run now, or stash behind a dialog); `ui/nuke/NukeUnlockHost` is the
dialog (scan, or type a fresh 64-char code via the reused `ChallengeDialog`).

| Action | Nuke off | Nuke on |
|---|---|---|
| Turn Nuke on (scan or "Nuke now") | needs a key + a non-empty enforceable list | — |
| Turn Nuke off | — | key scan or emergency code |
| Add an app | free | free |
| Remove an app | free | key or code |
| Pair the first key | free | — (a key exists whenever Nuke is on) |
| Replace / remove the key | free | key or code (removing also ends Nuke) |
| Master toggle OFF (Home) | Strict Mode's gate only | Nuke's gate, THEN Strict Mode's |
| Master toggle OFF (Protection widget) | allowed unless Strict Mode | refused in the widget; opens the app |
| Import a backup | cannot touch Nuke | cannot touch Nuke |

Every unlock re-reads the LIVE key (a re-pair between opening the dialog and scanning counts), and
every trip into typing mode generates a NEW code.

**Pairing a generated QR requires scanning it back once** before it is saved. That proves the user
kept it somewhere a camera can see; pairing a code they never saved would leave the emergency code as
the only way out. A phone with no camera cannot pair at all, and the screen says so rather than
letting every scan silently return nothing.

### The master toggle gate
Every enforcement path sits behind `globalEnabled`, so with Nuke on the master switch is the obvious
one-tap way around it. `HomeViewModel.toggleGlobalEnabled` routes ON→OFF through `NukeGate` first
(when `masterToggleOffRequiresUnlock`) and then through the existing Strict Mode gate. Turning it ON
is never gated. Passing the gate turns the master toggle off but leaves Nuke's state as it was, so
turning Nudge back on resumes Nuke; the global toggle means "behave as if uninstalled", and that
includes Nuke.

The Protection widget's `togglesInWidget` is `!(enabled && (strictModeEnabled || nukeActive))`, and
`ToggleProtectionAction` carries `!strictModeEnabled && !nukeActive` on the same line as the write
(`WidgetStrictModeContractTest`, `WidgetSnapshotMapperTest` over all sixteen inputs). The updater
collects `nukeState.active`, so the widget re-renders when Nuke changes.

### The OS escape route
While Nuke is on the Strict Mode escape-route guard (`StrictModeGuardActivity` over the Nudge
accessibility toggle and App Info / Force stop / Uninstall) engages as if Strict Mode were on, with
the challenge at `max(64, Strict Mode length)` and Nuke copy (`EXTRA_NUKE`). Solving it opens the
usual 60-second grace window. This reuses the one guard rather than building a second: its safety
invariant — cancel always goes home, the challenge is always solvable — is the same code path it
always was. It does NOT end Nuke; it lets the user do the OS action they committed to (after which
enforcement stops because the service stops, and Nuke resumes if they turn it back on).

## Safety floor

Nuke must never block what a phone cannot be without, or the ways out of Nudge: the dialer and
in-call UI, emergency apps, the launcher, SystemUI, Settings (every OEM settings package the escape
guard knows), the installer/permission dialogs, every keyboard (the emergency code is TYPED), and
Nudge itself. `NukePolicy.STATIC_FLOOR` is the static half; `NukeSafetyFloor` adds THIS phone's
launcher, dialer and keyboards. The floor is applied in three places: the picker never offers a floor
package, `NukePolicy.isNuked` refuses one even if stored, and the service's cache is built through
`NukePolicy.enforceable` with `isNukedNow` re-checking the static half. "Arm" counts only enforceable
packages, so a list of only floor apps cannot be armed.

## Export / import

Nuke state is DEVICE-LOCAL, like the emergency-pass ledger. `ExportedSettings` has no Nuke field, an
export never mentions it, and `applyImportedSettings` cannot write a `NUKE_*` key: a hand-edited
backup saying `"nukeActive": false` would otherwise end Nuke without the key, and one carrying a
`nukeKeyHash` would swap it. Pinned by `NukeExportExclusionTest` (the real exporter over a hostile
file) and `ImportedSettingsWriteContractTest`'s device-local list.

## Threat model, and its honest limits

Nuke is a commitment device against the user's own impulses, not a security boundary against an
adversary. What it closes: every in-app path (list edits, key swaps, master toggle, widget, import),
every grant (pass, cooldown, passthrough), the browser-as-website path, and — best-effort — the OS
screens that switch Nudge off.

What it cannot close, and does not pretend to:
- **Safe mode, `adb`, a factory reset, or a second device** all bypass any app-level blocker.
- **The escape-route guard is best-effort detection**, tuned on AOSP/English (see `strict-mode.md`).
  An OEM settings screen or locale it does not recognise is simply not guarded — a miss, never a
  trap.
- **A reboot before the service binds**: Nuke state persists and is re-read on bind, but between
  boot and the accessibility service connecting, nothing is enforced (true of every block).
- **The key is only as far away as the user put it.** A barcode on the fridge is a short walk.
- **The emergency code is deliberately always solvable.** Sixty-four characters is friction, not a
  lock; the product rule is that Nudge can never hard-trap anyone.

## Tests

| L1 | `BlockEngineNukeTest` | Nuke overrides every mode × limit × feature, and the non-nuked answer is byte-for-byte the old one |
| L1 | `EvaluateBlockNukeTest` | through the real use case: nuked → Nuke decision with no rule/usage read; not listed / off / floor → the rule's answer |
| L1 | `NukeGateTest` | key, wrong key, cancelled scan, live re-read, fresh emergency code, exact typing, cancel |
| L1 | `NukeViewModelTest` | arm needs key + list, key toggles, wrong key does not disarm, emergency disarms, remove/replace/unpair gated only while on, add free, QR saved only after the same code is scanned back, the picker never offers the floor |
| L1 | `HomeNukeToggleGateTest` | master toggle OFF waits for the key or the code while Nuke is on |
| L4 | `NukeExportExclusionTest`, `ImportedSettingsWriteContractTest` | nothing about Nuke leaves or enters through a backup |
| contract | `NukeWiringContractTest` | every grant sits in `grantLetsThrough`, a nuked app never consults it, nuked browser, content-change + feature paths, re-evaluate on arm, overlay flag + fingerprint, escape guard, the Nuke overlay has no pass and walks away through `navigateHome` |
| contract | `WidgetStrictModeContractTest`, `WidgetSnapshotMapperTest` | the widget cannot turn Nudge off during Nuke |
| L6 | device case list in the Nuke PR | the overlay on a real app, no pass, reboot persistence, the Settings guard, the camera flows |
