# Strict Mode (commitment lock) and the global master toggle

Covers the typed-challenge lock on every protection-weakening action, the OS escape-route guard
(Settings / App Info pages), and the global master toggle that must suppress ALL enforcement when off.
**Read before touching `domain/lock/`, `ui/lock/`, `StrictModeEscape*`, or any gate in `onAccessibilityEvent`.**

## Strict Mode (commitment lock) architecture — v1.7.0

Opt-in lock that gates every protection-WEAKENING action behind a typed unlock challenge. Strengthening is never gated. Two layers: in-app gate + OS escape-route guard.

- **Prefs** (`NudgePreferences`): `strictModeEnabled` (default false) + `strictModeChallengeLength` (default 24; Easy 12 / Medium 24 / Hard 48). Same `Flow` + setter pattern as `globalEnabled`.
- **`domain/lock/StrictModeChallenge.kt`** — pure Kotlin. `generate(length)` (unambiguous charset, excludes 0/O/1/l/I), `forDisplay` (dash-grouped chunks of 5), `normalize`/`rawLength` (dash- + whitespace-strip), `verify(input, target)` (case-sensitive, dash-insensitive **both** directions). The dialog counter and `verify` share `normalize`, so "x/y" can never disagree with what's compared.
- **`domain/lock/RuleWeakening.kt`** — pure `isWeakening(old, new)`: disable, mode softening (HARD_BLOCK>DELAY>BREATHING>none), shorter delay, and (v1.10.0) any auto-kick axis softened — `dailyLimitMinutes`, `autoKickAfter` and `autoKickAfterMinutes` raised-or-removed-when-set (one shared `isNullableAllowanceRaised` helper: all three are "allowances" that permit more usage the higher they are), plus `autoKickCooldownSeconds` **lowered** (note the inverted direction: a shorter cooldown lets you back in sooner).
- **`domain/lock/SettingsWeakening.kt`** (v1.10.0) — the same idea for the Settings screen's global switches. `requiresUnlock(toggle, enable, strictModeEnabled)` over `LockedToggle` = { `STRICT_MODE` (OFF weakens), `EMERGENCY_PASS` (ON weakens — it re-opens a one-tap bypass) }. Nothing is gated while Strict Mode is off. The escape-hatch toggle is deliberately **not** frozen under Strict Mode; see the Daily-2-minute-pass section in `block-overlay-lifecycle.md`.
- **`ui/lock/StrictModeGate.kt`** — ViewModel-side helper: `run(prompt, action)` runs immediately if Strict Mode off, else defers the action and emits a `ChallengeState` the screen renders. Used by `HomeViewModel` (global toggle ON→OFF only), `ActiveRulesViewModel` (rule disable), `UnifiedAppConfigViewModel` (weakening save / delete). `SettingsScreen` has no ViewModel, so it runs the same contract locally: one `PendingSettingsUnlock` slot (target + prompt + deferred action) feeding `ChallengeDialog`, with `SettingsWeakening.requiresUnlock` deciding which flips are gated — covering Strict-Mode-OFF **and** escape-hatch-ON.
- **`ui/components/ChallengeDialog.kt`** — the unlock UI. Paste/copy suppressed via a no-op `LocalTextToolbar`; `imeAction=Done` clears focus to dismiss the keyboard. Fresh target per open.
- **Escape-route guard** (the OS-bypass layer):
  - `domain/lock/StrictModeEscapeGuard.kt` — pure `shouldGuardSettingsScreen(foregroundPkg, windowText, appLabel, strictEnabled, withinGrace)`. Fails CLOSED (blank/empty/exception → no guard); biased to fewer false positives (requires a settings package AND the app label AND a strong escape signal).
  - **Detection signatures** (tuned against live AOSP Settings on the Pixel 3, Android 12; app label "Nudge - App Blocker"): a11y **detail** page (`com.android.settings/.SubSettings`) keys on the label + **"shortcut"** / **"use <label>"** — NOT the bare word "accessibility", because the a11y **list** page also shows our label (that was the false-positive to avoid). App Info page (`.applications.InstalledAppDetails`) keys on label + **"Force stop"** + **"Uninstall"**.
  - `service/StrictModeEscapeManager.kt` (`@Singleton`) — in-memory 60s grace window (modeled on `PassthroughManager`); while in grace the service short-circuits so a committed user can complete their toggle/uninstall.
  - `ui/lock/StrictModeGuardActivity.kt` — full-screen overlay reusing `ChallengeDialog`; unlock → `grantGrace()` + finish (back to Settings); cancel/back/dismiss → reliable `GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME` (HOME-intent fallback). Registered in manifest like `BlockOverlayActivity` (singleInstance, excludeFromRecents, empty taskAffinity).
  - `NudgeAccessibilityService` guards in `onAccessibilityEvent` before the `SYSTEM_PACKAGES` early-return; bounded node-text harvest (≤800 nodes); Strict Mode flags cached off-main so the hot path never blocks on DataStore. `accessibility_service_config.xml` gained `flagRetrieveInteractiveWindows`.
  - **OEM/locale caveat**: detection is best-effort, verified only on AOSP/English. Other settings packages are tolerated in `SETTINGS_PACKAGES` but unverified; an untuned OEM/locale screen simply isn't guarded (a miss, never a trap). Safety invariant: the lock can never hard-trap the user — cancel always goes home, the challenge is always solvable, Strict Mode off disables all guarding.
- **Tests**: `StrictModeChallengeTest` (charset/length/uniqueness, verify exact + dash/whitespace-insensitive both directions), `RuleWeakeningTest` (every axis both directions), `SettingsWeakeningTest` (both toggles, both directions, strict on/off), `StrictModeGateTest` (off=immediate, on=deferred-then-run/cancel, + the Settings-screen composition for the escape-hatch toggle), `StrictModeEscapeGuardTest` (guard/no-guard matrix + list-page-not-trapped, fail-closed, OEM pkg), `StrictModeEscapeManagerTest` (grace open/expire/clear/re-grant).

## Global master toggle gating — v1.9.2

The home-screen master switch (`globalEnabled`, `NudgePreferences`) must suppress **all** enforcement when off — a disabled Nudge behaves as if uninstalled. Previously only the async rule-evaluation coroutine checked `isGlobalEnabled`; the synchronous auto-kick **cooldown** block (and counter/auto-kick paths) ran *before* that check, so a cooled-down or over-limit app still kicked the user after they toggled Nudge off.

- **Cached flag**: `NudgeAccessibilityService.globalEnabledCached` (`@Volatile`, defaults **true** = fail toward enforcement), collected off-main in `onServiceConnected` via the same cached-flags pattern as Strict Mode, so the hot accessibility path reads it synchronously without blocking on DataStore.
- **Single synchronous gate**: in `onAccessibilityEvent`, after the Strict-Mode escape guard + `SYSTEM_PACKAGES` return and **before** the `when(eventType)` dispatch, `if (!globalEnabledCached) { hideAllOverlays(); return }`. Because every enforcement path (rule eval, auto-kick cooldown overlay, auto-kick via `InteractionHandler`, counter + time-remaining overlays, web-domain, content filter, in-app feature detection) is downstream of that dispatch, one gate covers them all.
- **Toggle-off teardown** (`onGlobalDisabled`, fired on the cached-flag's true→false transition): `InteractionTracker.clearAllCooldowns()` + `EmergencyPassManager.cancelAll()` + hide awareness overlays (on Main). The emergency-pass expiry kick is also gated on `isGlobalEnabled` inside the job.
- **Strict Mode is independent**: the escape guard for the Settings/App-Info screens stays active regardless of `globalEnabled` (it's a commitment lock, not app-blocking), and Strict Mode's gate on turning the master toggle OFF is unchanged.
- **Tested**: `InteractionTrackerCooldownTest.clearAllCooldowns…`; device-verified (Calculator blocked when ON, usable when OFF, re-blocked when ON).

## Nuke Mode reuses the escape-route guard and gates the master toggle (2026-09-29)

While Nuke is on, `maybeGuardSettingsEscape` engages as if Strict Mode were on (at the Nuke emergency
code's length, never less than the Strict Mode difficulty, with Nuke copy via
`StrictModeGuardActivity.EXTRA_NUKE`), and turning the master toggle OFF goes through Nuke's own gate
before Strict Mode's. The guard's invariants are unchanged. Full model: `nuke-mode.md`.
