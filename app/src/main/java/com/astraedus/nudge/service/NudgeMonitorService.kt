/**
 * The foreground service that keeps Nudge's process alive — and, since 2026-09-07, the only thing
 * in the app that can notice Nudge has stopped working and say so.
 *
 * ## What this service is NOT
 * It does not poll foreground apps, read rules, or make block decisions. Every enforcement decision
 * in Nudge is made by [NudgeAccessibilityService] from an accessibility event and gated on a rule
 * that matches the foreground package. **Nothing here may ever start an Activity.** The only
 * `MainActivity` reference in this file is a `PendingIntent` — a destination for a tap the user
 * makes, not a launch this service performs. `MonitorServiceContractTest` pins that distinction,
 * because a service that can put its own UI over another app is indistinguishable from a bug.
 *
 * ## The failure it now reports
 * At 01:59 on 2026-09-07 the Pixel's nightly `full_backup_package dev.astraedus.nudge` killed the
 * process. The OS rescheduled both services and Android's Settings screen said "Enabled, but your
 * phone stopped it, turn it off and back on to restart blocking". Nudge's own notification said
 * "Nudge is active / Monitoring app usage" the whole time, because that text was a constant. An app
 * blocker that has stopped blocking and still claims it is blocking is worse than one that crashes:
 * nothing prompts the user to fix it.
 *
 * So the notification is now a function of [ServiceHealth], re-evaluated whenever that health can
 * have changed, and a degraded state hands off to [ProtectionCheck], which owns the one alert this
 * app raises about blocking being down. `allowBackup` is off as of the same change, which removes
 * the nightly kill that produced this window in the first place: this re-evaluation is the belt to
 * that braces.
 *
 * ## Two clocks, one decision
 * This service and [ProtectionWatchdogWorker] both reach [ProtectionCheck], and they are not
 * redundant. This one is fast but exists only while this process does, and the process dying is
 * the failure being watched for. The worker is slow (WorkManager's 15-minute floor) but survives
 * it. Neither holds any policy: the confirming cycle and the alert cooldown live in
 * `ProtectionWatchdog`, so the same fault produces the same decision from either clock.
 *
 * ## What [#63](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/63) changed, and why
 *
 * A user read their own battery with BetterBatteryStats and found Nudge taking the
 * `NotificationManagerService:post:dev.astraedus.nudge` wakelock **267 times in 10h24m**, holding
 * the CPU awake ~5 minutes overnight and repeatedly interrupting Deep Doze. They also reported the
 * tell that names the cause: swipe the permanent notification away and it is back in seconds, with
 * identical text. Three separate mistakes produced that, and all three are fixed here:
 *
 * 1. **The poll re-posted the notification on every tick**, unconditionally. There is no
 *    platform-side dedup — `NotificationManagerService` takes its post wakelock before it looks at
 *    the content — so a byte-identical re-post costs a real one. [StatusNotificationGate] now holds
 *    the fingerprint of what is on screen and a tick that changes nothing posts nothing.
 * 2. **Every [start] re-ran `onStartCommand`**, and `onStartCommand` must call `startForeground`,
 *    which is another post. `NudgeAccessibilityService` calls [sync] from its `isGlobalEnabled`
 *    collector, and that flow re-emitted on *every* DataStore write in the app — including the one
 *    `ProtectionCheck` makes on each watchdog cycle. [start] now returns early when the service is
 *    already running (which its own doc always claimed it did), and `isGlobalEnabled` is
 *    `distinctUntilChanged` at the source.
 * 3. **The poll was a 30-second timer** where almost everything it watches for actually fires an
 *    event. See below.
 *
 * ## Event first, timeout second
 *
 * The original comment here said "poll rather than observe: the system unbound our service fires no
 * callback we can receive in a process that was not running at the time". That is true, and it is
 * an argument for [ProtectionWatchdogWorker] — not for this timer. In a process that IS running, an
 * unbind fires [AccessibilityConnectionSignal] from the accessibility service's own `onDestroy`,
 * and a rebind fires it from `onServiceConnected`; the master toggle is a Flow. So health is
 * re-evaluated on those two events, and [HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS] is now only the backstop for a
 * change neither of them announced.
 *
 * That costs alert latency on a fault that emits no event at all — worst case
 * [HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS] instead of 30 seconds to the *first* sighting — and there is no known
 * reachable fault of that shape, because disabling the permission unbinds the service and a process
 * kill takes this service with it. In exchange the idle device is left alone: a
 * `kotlinx.coroutines.delay` holds no wakelock and does not wake the phone, so with the notification
 * gated, an untouched Nudge now costs Doze nothing at all.
