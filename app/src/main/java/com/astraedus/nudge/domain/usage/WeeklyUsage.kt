/**
 * Screen time for a window of consecutive days, per day and per app.
 *
 * This is the single value the day-scoped stats screens read: the bars are [dailyTotals], the
 * drill-down under them is [perAppOn] / [totalOn] for the selected day. Because both come out of
 * one object built by one pass over one event stream, a bar and the numbers beneath it cannot
 * disagree — which they did, badly, when the series came from `queryUsageStats(INTERVAL_DAILY)`
 * and the drill-down from `queryEvents`.
 *
 * Days are addressed by their **start timestamp**, not by index, wherever a caller has one.
 * Index lookups are fine within a single value, but a screen holds its selection separately from
 * the loaded window, and during the frame after the window moves an index would silently point
 * at a different date. [perAppOn] answers "the day that starts here", or nothing.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin; JVM-tested in `WeeklyUsageTest`.
 *
 * @param dayStartsMs epoch millis of each day's local midnight, ascending, oldest first.
 * @param perDayPerApp package -> foreground millis, one map per entry in [dayStartsMs]. Only
 *   packages with time actually spent appear; there are no zero-valued entries.

     *
     * Matched to the NEAREST day start, within [SAME_DAY_TOLERANCE_MS], rather than by equality.
     * The caller's day start comes from `java.time` (`LocalDate.atStartOfDay`) while these come
     * from `Calendar`, and in the handful of zones whose DST transition happens AT midnight the
     * two normalise a non-existent local midnight to the same instant only by convention. An
     * exact match that missed would blank a real day — the very symptom being fixed — while days
     * here are at least 23 hours apart, so half a day of slack cannot reach a neighbour.
