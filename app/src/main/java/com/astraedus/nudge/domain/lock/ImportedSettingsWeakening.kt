/**
 * Pure policy for the third weakening surface: restoring a backup file's app SETTINGS over this
 * device's.
 *
 * Sibling of [RuleWeakening] (per-rule edits) and [SettingsWeakening] (Settings-screen toggle
 * flips). It exists as its own object rather than as another [LockedToggle] because the question is
 * a different one: those two ask "is flipping this switch in this direction weakening?", while an
 * import compares a whole incoming CONFIGURATION against the current one, field by field, where
 * most fields will be unchanged no-ops.
 *
 * Why it matters: an export file is a plain, hand-editable JSON document. Without this, a user
 * under Strict Mode could type `"strictModeEnabled": false` into a text editor and import their way
 * straight out of the commitment lock — the exact bypass Strict Mode exists to prevent, on the one
 * path that writes settings without going through the Settings screen.
 *
 * No Android imports — unit-testable on the JVM.

     * True when applying [incoming] over [current] would reduce protection on ANY axis.

     * Each axis is judged independently, exactly as [RuleWeakening] does: softening one setting is
     * weakening even when another is strengthened, because the user must justify the part that
     * takes protection away.
     *
     * A null [incoming] (a backup carrying no settings) is never weakening. A null FIELD inside
     * [incoming] is likewise never weakening — the file does not carry that setting, so the
     * device's own value survives untouched and nothing changes.
     *
     * The custom block-message pools are deliberately not an axis. They change what the overlay
     * SAYS, never whether or how long it blocks.
