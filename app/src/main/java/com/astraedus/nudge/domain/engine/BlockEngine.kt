     * Evaluate whether a package should be blocked based on active rules and daily usage.

     * @param detectedFeature If non-null, feature-scoped rules whose [ActiveRule.inAppFeatures]
     *   list contains this feature will be considered. Whole-app rules are also considered unless
     *   [includeWholeAppRulesForFeature] is false.
     *
     * Priority: NUKE > HARD_BLOCK > time budget exceeded > DELAY > HOLD > BREATHING > Allow
     *
     * @param nuked whether Nuke Mode covers [packageName] right now
     *   ([com.astraedus.nudge.domain.nuke.NukePolicy.isNuked], decided by the caller because it
     *   needs persisted state and the device's safety floor). When true it is the FIRST step and
     *   the only one: a hard block with no delay, no budget arithmetic and no rule consulted, so it
     *   overrides every mode and every limit rather than competing with them. Grants (passthrough,
     *   the daily pass, a cooldown) are not inputs here at all; the service skips all three for a
     *   nuked app before it asks. See `docs/architecture/nuke-mode.md`.
     *
     * [BlockMode.NONE] deliberately matches none of the block branches below, so a rule carrying
     * it yields Allow. It still participates in the time-budget check, which keys off
     * `dailyLimitMinutes` rather than the mode — an app-level NONE rule with a daily limit means
     * "don't gate this app, but stop me after N minutes", and its counter/overlay settings still
     * apply. This is what lets a feature-scoped rule (Shorts, Reels) block while its host app
     * stays open.
