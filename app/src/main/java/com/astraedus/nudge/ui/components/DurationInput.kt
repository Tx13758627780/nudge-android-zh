/**
 * Pure helpers behind the free-form "minutes" inputs used by the auto-kick controls.
 *
 * The UI works in MINUTES because that is how users think about "use it for 30 minutes, then block
 * it for 15" ([issue #6](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/6)). The database stores the
 * auto-kick cooldown in SECONDS (`BlockRule.autoKickCooldownSeconds`), so the conversion lives here
 * — one place, unit-tested — rather than being re-derived at each of the three editor sites.
 *
 * No Android imports in the helpers: [DurationInput] is fully JVM-testable.
