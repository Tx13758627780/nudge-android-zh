/**
 * Replays the two reported event sequences through the REAL pipeline: the real [EventClassifier]
 * the service uses, feeding the real [BlockLaunchGuard] and the real [SittingTracker] from the one
 * signal, exactly as `NudgeAccessibilityService.applyForegroundSignal` does.
 *
 * `BlockLaunchGateTest` proves the gate's function is right. This proves the STREAM produces the
 * state that function needs, which is the gap every bug in
 * `docs/architecture/foreground-detection.md` fell into, because each of those functions was also
 * individually correct.
 *
 * Two kinds of sequence live here, and the difference is worth stating.
 *
 * The DUPLICATE-BLOCK case replays a real Pixel 3 stream,
 * `app/src/test/resources/a11y-captures/picker-subflow-keeps-sitting.jsonl`, committed since
 * v1.16.0 and already carrying the defect. Nothing was captured for it; the timings were there all
 * along and nobody had looked at them in this light.
 *
 * The #26, #31 and #58 sequences are SYNTHESISED, and deliberately NOT committed to that directory:
 * it holds real device streams, and a hand-written file sitting among them would be read as device
 * evidence by the next person. What makes them honest instead of hopeful is the COUNTERFACTUAL on
 * each one, the assertion that the pre-fix rule really does launch on this exact sequence. A
 * fixture that quietly stopped reproducing its defect would otherwise leave a green test asserting
 * nothing, the same trap `A11yCaptureReplayTest`'s counterfactuals exist to close.
 *
 * The one thing the synthesised ones cannot prove is the platform ordering that decides whether the
 * phantom window event happens at all. Three reporters see it every time and the bench Pixel 3
 * never does; that is device and launcher timing, and it is why the reproduction lives here.
