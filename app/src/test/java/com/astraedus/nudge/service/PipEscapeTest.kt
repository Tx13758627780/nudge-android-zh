/**
 * Tests for issue #19: picture-in-picture defeats blocking — and for the v1.12.0 field failure of
 * the first attempt at fixing it.
 *
 * **What actually happens.** An app in PiP keeps playing in a floating always-on-top window. Our
 * block overlay is fullscreen and the top resumed activity and still loses; that is platform
 * behaviour. Nudge cannot flip the per-app PiP permission on the user's behalf, so the fix is
 * detect-and-deep-link.
 *
 * **Field failure 1 — detection never fired, silently.** On a live Pixel 3 / API 31 bubble the
 * accessibility window list contains TWO windows flagged `pictureInPicture=true`:
 * SystemUI's `Picture-in-Picture menu` (TYPE_SYSTEM, listed first) and the app's own window
 * (TYPE_APPLICATION). The first implementation took the first flagged window, resolved its owner to
 * `com.android.systemui`, never matched the blocked package, and returned false without logging.
 * Hence [PipWindowProbe.pipPackages] filtering to application windows, and returning a SET.
 *
 * **Field failure 2 — the stat-inflation loop outlived the block.** The first fix only looked for
 * an escape while a block overlay was live. In reality the overlay dismisses and the orphaned
 * bubble keeps firing events carrying the app's package, each read as a fresh foreground entry:
 * nine re-blocks in five minutes, +11 on the all-time Blocked count, firing while the tester was
 * inside Nudge itself. Hence [PipWindowProbe.pipOnlyPackages] and a gate over the whole pipeline.
