/**
 * Source-level guard on what a *service* is allowed to do to the user's screen, and on the app's
 * backup posture.
 *
 * ## The report this came from
 * A QA session on 2026-09-07 reported Nudge "throwing MainActivity in front of Telegram" during the
 * window after the nightly backup killed the process, with no rule targeting Telegram and no block
 * events recorded — and attributed it to [NudgeMonitorService] relaunching the UI. The source says
 * otherwise: nothing in this app has ever called `startActivity` with `MainActivity`, and the
 * monitor service reads no rules and makes no decisions. That the explanation was *plausible* is
 * the point. A foreground service that could surface its own UI over an arbitrary app would be
 * indistinguishable, from outside, from exactly this report — so the property is worth pinning
 * before someone adds it for a good-sounding reason (a "service stopped, tap to restart" prompt is
 * the obvious one, and it belongs in a notification).
 *
 * None of this is JVM-testable behaviourally: `Service`, `NotificationManager` and the accessibility
 * bind are all platform. The defect class lives in the SHAPE of the code, so this pins the shape,
 * the way `HomeScreenPassthroughContractTest` and `OverlayBackAndInsetsContractTest` already do.
