/**
 * Issue [#56](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/56): where the Following steer is allowed to
 * learn that a visit ended.
 *
 * `FollowingSteerVisitLifecycleTest` proves the BEHAVIOUR given the wire. This file is about the
 * wire's placement, which no value-level test can see: the steer's memory used to be cleared inside
 * `hideAllOverlays`, one of whose two callers is the `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF` receiver. Nothing about
 * either object was wrong. What was wrong was which line called which, and a display timeout on
 * Instagram's home feed therefore re-steered a user who had deliberately chosen that feed.
 *
 * ## The shape of the assertions
 *
 * `docs/testing-strategy.md` rule (e): check an **absence of a whole defect class**, or a **count
 * over a discovered set** - never the presence of a particular spelling. So:
 *
 *  - the screen-off receiver, and the overlay teardown it calls, must not reach the steer at all
 *    (absence, and it is the defect class itself: "a broadcast decides a visit ended");
 *  - the set of REASONS the steer's memory is cleared for is discovered from the source and
 *    compared as a set, so a fifth caller cannot appear without someone editing this list and
 *    saying why.
 *
 * The one presence assertion is the departure verdict actually reaching the reset, and it is here
 * for the reason `EventDispatchOrderContractTest` keeps its `onInteraction` twin: a model fix that
 * nobody calls is a silent no-op with a green suite, and this repo has shipped that exact thing.
