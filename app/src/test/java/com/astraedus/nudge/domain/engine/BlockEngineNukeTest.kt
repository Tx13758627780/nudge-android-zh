/**
 * L1: Nuke OVERRIDES every existing mode and limit, rather than joining them as one more case.
 *
 * The truth table is over EVERY [BlockMode] (so a mode added later is covered without editing this
 * file), with and without a daily limit that is spent, with and without an in-app feature in play,
 * and with rules that would otherwise ALLOW. The assertion is the whole decision, compared by value:
 * a Nuke block that inherited a delay, a daily-limit label, grayscale or a tab cover from whatever
 * rule happened to be there would be a Nuke that is partly a rule.
