/**
 * Every branch of the launch gate, and the combinations that matter.
 *
 * The two issues this gate closes have opposite shapes, which is why the combination cases below
 * are the interesting ones rather than padding:
 *
 *  - [#31](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/31): the decision is stale because the user
 *    moved. The foreground check catches it and the walk-away window is irrelevant.
 *  - [#26](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/26): the decision is stale because the user is
 *    LEAVING, and at the instant it lands the blocked app genuinely is in front. The foreground
 *    check is powerless; only the walk-away window can see it.
